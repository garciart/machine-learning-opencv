Windows:
-- Must use Python 3
-- Must pip install as administrator.
-- Shapely depends on GEOS. If Shapely fails to install, try the following (thanks Jozef Cechovsky at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13144158/python-geos-and-shapely-on-windows-64):
install osgeo4w from https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
add installed folder to path e.g. C:\OSGeo4W64\bin (must contain geos_c.dll)
restart command line
-- Watch your directory structure!
-- Make sure all packages work with TensorFlow 1.5. Do not use TensorFlow 2.0 (e.g., TensorFlow 1.15 and Keras 2.2.5)
-- Commit without COCo dataset. Use .gitignore
